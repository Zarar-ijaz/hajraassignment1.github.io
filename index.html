      <h1>Creativity</h1><br>
      <p>The need for the teachers of one of the private universities which is located within the Eastern Mediterranean
        region and is in charge of the Department of Education not only to recall their understanding of creativity but
        also to examine the assumptions and perceptions of creativity among early childhood student teachers arose from
        the pandemic teaching and learning arrangement. More specifically, we investigated the beliefs regarding the
        creative ideals, traits of the creative person, and the nature and potential of the creative education process
        and its importance for the professional improvement of 15 junior early childhood teachers students through
        informal interviews with these early childhood students. The article addresses the outcome of a qualitative
        descriptive research investigation carried out in the context of the course entitled Designing Activities in
        Kindergarten. Furthermore, it addresses the findings of the semi-structured interviews which aimed at finding
        out what concepts regarding creativity early childhood students have, and what evidence they need to support the
        idea that early childhood students need a structure and a generic scheme for idea and lesson development.

      <p>While creativity was reserved for the elite during the Renaissance period, Csikszentmihaly (2006) acknowledges
        how far along the evolution of our species has come where now creativity has become a necessity for us all.
        According to De Bono (1992), “Creativity is priceless; its importance is indisputable. It is development at its
        core. For there is no creativity (and thus no inspiration, p. 169) without creativity, and if there is no
        creativity life would go the same way ad infinitum” (p. 168). Both Creative and Critical thinking</p>
