            <p class="w3-opacity"><i>We love music</i></p>
            <p class="w3-justify">Mathematics has often been viewed as a rigid and structured subject, where the focus
                is placed on getting the correct answer. However, creative thinking in math involves exploring concepts
                from different angles, asking “what if” questions, and using imagination to solve problems. Teachers can
                play a crucial role in shifting this perception by incorporating creativity into their teaching
                strategies.Teachers can facilitate creativity by adopting teaching methods that encourage active
                participation, problem-solving, and independent thinking. Rather than focusing solely on procedural
                tasks or rote memorization, educators can create opportunities for students to apply mathematical
                concepts in real-world contexts, make connections between ideas, and engage with mathematical thinking
                in a more playful and open-ended way.Creativity in mathematics is often overlooked, with a common
                emphasis on mastery of basic skills and formulas. However, research suggests that creativity is an
                essential part of mathematical thinking. Mathematics is inherently creative—it involves pattern
                recognition, logical reasoning, and the development of innovative strategies for solving complex
                problems. By fostering creativity in mathematics education, children can develop a deeper appreciation
                for the subject and strengthen their problem-solving abilities.Moreover, numeracy, which refers to the
                ability to use and apply mathematics in daily life, can be significantly enhanced through creative
                approaches. Creative numeracy activities help children see the practical application of math, connect it
                to their everyday experiences, and build a foundation of skills that they can use in a variety of
                contexts.Fostering creativity in mathematics and numeracy has numerous benefits for young learners.
                First, it helps build a strong foundation in mathematical thinking, which is essential for future
                learning. Creative activities promote problem-solving skills, logical reasoning, and abstract thinking,
                which are all vital for academic success in mathematics.Second, creativity enhances students' engagement
                and motivation. When students are allowed to explore math in a creative, hands-on way, they are more
                likely to develop a positive attitude toward the subject. This leads to increased confidence in their
                mathematical abilities, which can encourage further exploration and mastery.Third, creativity in math
                teaches students to embrace failure as part of the learning process. By encouraging experimentation and
                exploration, teachers help students understand that making mistakes is a natural and valuable part of
                learning. This mindset fosters resilience and perseverance, both of which are essential qualities for
                success in mathematics and other areas of life.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Problem-based learning is an excellent method for promoting
                                creativity in mathematics. In this approach, students are presented with open-ended
                                problems that require them to think critically and explore various solutions. For
                                example, rather than simply teaching the concept of addition, a teacher could pose a
                                real-world problem, such as planning a party, where students need to figure out the
                                number of guests, seating arrangements, and food quantities. This approach encourages
                                students to think mathematically while also being creative in finding solutions.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Incorporating games and puzzles into the curriculum is a fun
                                and engaging way to foster creativity in mathematics. Games such as Sudoku, tangrams,
                                and logic puzzles not only encourage problem-solving but also help students see math as
                                enjoyable and stimulating. Teachers can design math-related games that require students
                                to think critically, strategize, and apply their mathematical knowledge in a playful,
                                non-threatening environment. These activities promote creative thinking while
                                reinforcing important mathematical concepts.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Inquiry-based learning encourages students to ask questions
                                and explore mathematical concepts based on their curiosities. Teachers can create an
                                environment where students are not simply given answers but are encouraged to ask “why”
                                and “how” questions. For example, students might explore why certain patterns appear in
                                numbers or how geometry can be used to solve real-world problems. By promoting curiosity
                                and critical thinking, inquiry-based learning helps students develop a creative mindset
                                that is essential for mathematical exploration.</p>
